## 3 Groups

### 3.1 Integer Equivalence Classes and Symmetrics

#### Definition
+ A binary operation or law of composition on set G is a function on G $\times$ G -> G that assigns to each pair
  (a,b) $\in$ G $\times$ G a unique element a $\circ$ b ,or ab in G, called the composition of a and b. A group (G,$\circ$) is a set of G together with a law of composition (a,b) -> a $\circ$ b that satisfies the following axioms.
  - The law of composition is associative.That is (a $\circ$ b) $\circ$ c = a $\circ$ (b $\circ$ c), for a,b,c $\in$ G .
  - There exists a element in G called the identity element, such that for any element a $\in$ G , e $\circ$ a = a $\circ$ e = a.
  - For each element a in G, there exists an inverse element in G, denoted by a<sup>-1</sup>, such that a $\circ$ a<sup>-1</sup> = a<sup>-1</sup> $\circ$ a = e.
+ Definition of abelian or commutative group. A group G with the property that a $\circ$ b = b $\circ$ a for all a,  b $\in$ G.
####  Basic Properties of Groups
+ Proposition 3.17 The ideentity element of group G is unique.
+ Proposition 3.18 If g is any element in a group G, then the inverse element of g, denoted by g<sup>-1</sup> is unique.
+ Propostion 3.19 Let G be  a group, if a,b $\in$ G then (ab)<sup>-1</sup> = b<sup>-1</sup>a<sup>-1</sup>
+ Proposition 3.20 Let G be a group, if g $\in$ G ,then (a<sup>-1</sup>)<sup>-1</sup> = a.
+ Proposition 3.21 Let G be a group and a, b be any two elements in G, then equations ax=b and xa=b have unique solutions in G.
+ Proposition 3.22 If G is a group and a,b,c $\in$ G,then ba =ca implies b=c and ab=ac impilies b=c.(left and right cancellation laws)
+ Theroem 3.23 In a group the usual laws of exponents holds, that is for all g, h $\in$ G, 
  - g<sup>m</sup> $\cdot$ g<sup>n</sup> = g<sup>m+n</sup>, for m,n $\in$ Z
  - (g<sup>m</sup>)<sup>n</sup> = g<sup>mn</sup>, for m,n $\in$ Z
  - (g $\cdot$ h)<sup>n</sup> = (h<sup>-1</sup>g<sup>-1</sup>)<sup>-n</sup>, for all n $\in$ Z,
